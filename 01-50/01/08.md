## 12 Hours On Luxury Alaska Train - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izdZOJv6No8)

**“How are you, Simon?”**
“David — nice to meet you.”
“Simon. And this is Kathy.”
“Kathy — lovely to meet you.”
“Nice to meet you, Simon.”

“Where are you both from?”
“Tennessee and Alaska. We purchased a house here three years ago.”
“So how do you find it compared to Tennessee?”
“We absolutely love it up here.”

*Honestly, the scenery from this train is unparalleled — I’ve never witnessed anything like it.*
“It looks like something straight out of a film, doesn’t it?”
“Exactly. That’s why we’re making a quick overnight trip to Fairbanks and heading back tomorrow.”
“Ah, so you’ve done this route numerous times.”

“I’m guessing we haven’t passed **Denali** yet?”
“No, not yet.”

“What did you have for lunch—did you eat as well?”
“Yeah, I had a burger, and she had the **chicken melt**. It was excellent.”

“So where are you from?”
“From Wales, in the UK.”
“Oh, we love Wales.”
“You’ve been?”
“Yes — we did a 12-day cruise through Scotland and Ireland.”
“Oh, Scotland is extraordinary, isn’t it?”

“What are you thinking for dinner?”
“I might go for the **pot roast**.”
“You know what — I think I’ll join you. I’m going to have the pot roast as well.”
“It’s on you, right?”
“Yes.”

“The **summer train** is significantly more expensive.”
“The Alaska summer service?”
“Yes.”

“How much is it normally in summer?”
“Between **$1,200 and $1,500 per person**.”
“Wow — just for a seat?”
“Yes. But it’s the **GoldStar Service** — upper-deck viewing car with dining below. Very luxurious.”

“So it’s essentially a **first-class excursion**. I didn’t realise that most tourism happens in summer. I assumed winter would be the peak because we associate Alaska with snow.”
“No, the crowds come in summer.”
“But winter is wonderful too.”
“Oh, we love winter.”
“So do we — I’d rather come in the cold.”

“I think this trip was about **$260**, wasn’t it?”
“Yes — compared to $1,200–$1,500 in summer, it’s quite a contrast.”

“How are you doing today?”
“Good, good.”

“Would you like anything for dinner?”
“I’ll have the **buffalo chicken**.”
“I’ll have the **pot roast**.”
“And could I have a pot roast as well, please?”
“Certainly — thank you.”

“Cheers — thank you so much.”

---

“So, what’s the verdict on the pot roast?”
“Good — really good.”
“It was excellent. I’m not sure it beats the chicken burger, but I’m definitely not complaining.”
“Cheers. Thank you.”

“So lovely meeting you — safe travels.”
“Thanks so much. You too. Have a great time in Mexico.”
“Short but wonderful trip — thank you.”
“Get your snow gear ready!”
“See you later — have a great one.”
“So nice meeting you.”
“You too — safe travels.”

“Thank you so much for all your help — really appreciate it.”
“Thank you.”
“Thanks, man — thanks for everything.”
“Thank you.”

“I think the next stop is **Fairbanks, Alaska**. Can’t be much longer now.”
“Nice to meet you, man — all the best.”
“We should take a photo.”
“Absolutely.”

“Maybe we’ll meet again in Taiwan or China.”
“Exactly — see you in Taipei one day.”

“What did you think of the journey?”
“Great — really great. Those mountains and views were astonishing, weren’t they?”
“Truly breathtaking.”

“Does Alaska beat Taipei, or is Taipei nicer?”
“Alaska is more **unique** — Alaska wins. But Taipei wins for **food and people**.”
“Oh absolutely — the cuisine and the people are extraordinary.”

---

*The train is finally empty. What an incredible experience.*
“Thank you — thank you so much for everything. It was a pleasure.”
“Thank you — safe travels.”
“I’ll be back.”
“You’d better!”
“Oh, I will — don’t worry about that.”

---

*What an extraordinary journey — **Alaska Railroad, 10 out of 10.**
Now I just need to find somewhere to buy a **coat**.”*
