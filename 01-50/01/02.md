## 12 Hours On Luxury Alaska Train - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izdZOJv6No8)

“Is **Manchester** considered a *major metropolitan city*?”

“Well, it’s reasonably large. Liverpool may arguably have the **superior football club**, but Manchester is still an exceptional city.”

“A **Manchester United** fan?”

“No.”

“You live in Manchester yet don’t support United?”

“Listen, I live there, but that doesn’t compel me to support the team.”

“You’re *not* a United fan, right?”

“Absolutely not.”

“Thank goodness.”

“But my family is.”

“You should convince them to support **Liverpool** instead.”

“I will.”

We have a **bank of seats** behind this carriage, and the train has just begun departing from **Anchorage**. There is an announcement: later in the journey, **additional passengers** will board, most of whom will occupy this car. Therefore, these rear seats are reserved for those embarking later.

He essentially said that we will be picking up many more passengers, so I probably won’t have these two seats to myself for much longer. *This train is astonishingly quiet.* I am travelling for **twelve hours**, and I have no idea how I will spend the time, but let’s see what is happening ahead. They are currently taking **meal reservations**.

“You’re on this train for twelve hours?”

“Yes.”

“We’re only on for two hours—we’re heading to **Talkeetna**.”

“Is that where you’re from?”

“No, I’ve never been there. She knows more about it than I do.”

“Are you getting breakfast?”

“Yes, definitely.”

“You’re not onboard long, so perhaps avoid drinking too much.”

“Oh, I appreciate that.”

“What’s that?”

“It’s a **Ghost energy drink**—flavoured like bubble gum.”

“Thank you so much. Appreciate it.”

I must definitely make a **meal reservation** since I will be onboard for the full duration and haven’t even had breakfast yet.

“Can I reserve both lunch and dinner?”

“Lunch begins at **11:00**, but due to limited capacity in the **dining car**, we seat passengers in groups. You’ll probably fall into the **12:30 or 1:00 p.m.** slot.”

“Perfect. And dinner?”

“Dinner starts at **4:00 p.m.**, but you’ll likely be in the **5:30–6:00** window.”

“And we arrive in Fairbanks at **8:00 p.m.**, right?”

“Yes. Would you like both meals?”

“Yes, please—just for one.”

“And breakfast?”

“I can add a breakfast reservation if you'd like.”

“Yes, please. Add it, and I’ll play it by ear. If I don’t show up, assume I changed my mind.”

“Perfect.”

“Is it a set menu?”

“You can check it using the **QR code** on the dining flyer in your **ticket pamphlet**. Scan it, scroll to the bottom, and open the **Aurora Winter Train Menu**. I’d recommend checking it now while you still have **mobile service**, because once coverage drops, the page won’t load properly. And yes, we do **not** have onboard Wi-Fi.”

“Thank you.”

Right—time to explore the train and find some breakfast. I think I’m in the **rear carriage**.

“Is this the end of the train?”

“Yes, this is the final car.”

“Perfect.”

Before heading to the front, I want to thank **Aero** for supporting my travels and sponsoring this video. Every time I travel, I need reliable **mobile data** in the country I’m visiting, and I cannot risk being stranded without connectivity. That is why I use **Aero eSIMs**.

Before travelling, I simply install an **eSIM** for the destination country. That way, I am never anxious about whether my phone will function upon arrival. Aero is available in all app stores; you can download the **Aero app** for free, purchase a data pack for your region, and stay connected. They cover **over 200 regions**.

For this journey, I selected the **US data package**, installed the eSIM, activated it, and I was ready to go. Aero’s eSIMs are **highly economical**, and they prevent shocking roaming bills. *If you are planning a trip to Alaska or anywhere in the US, I strongly recommend installing the Aero app so you can remain connected without incurring exorbitant roaming charges.*

Download **Aero** using the link in the description and enter code **SIMON3** for a **$3 discount**.

“Is this the engine up ahead?”

“This is the **Aurora Winter Train**, and it’s quite unique. In certain regions, we perform **flag stops**—locals use the train like a **rural taxi service**.”

“They literally wave at the train?”

“Yes. They stand beside the tracks, signal us, and we stop to sell them a ticket.”

“You’re serious?”

“Absolutely. Anywhere along the flag-stop segment—between **Talkeetna** and **Hurricane Section House**, roughly a **60-mile corridor**.”

“How do you determine the ticket price?”

“It’s calculated by **mileage**. One ticket covers **20 miles**. Most residents purchase one to three tickets, or a full **book of tickets** for **$125**.”

“I had no idea.”

“In that section, Dan and I will be moving back and forth to the **baggage car**, loading supplies—food, equipment—because those communities have **no road access**. *We are essentially their transportation lifeline.*”

“Do many people flag you down?”

“Some days I might get **20 to 40 flag stops**, but it’s unpredictable. With satellite service, some residents now purchase tickets in advance, so I occasionally know beforehand, but not always.”
