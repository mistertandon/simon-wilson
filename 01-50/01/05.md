## 12 Hours On Luxury Alaska Train - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izdZOJv6No8)

**“All right, come on down. Watch your step, hold onto the handrails, and take your time. Welcome to **Talkeetna**.”**

“Nice meeting you.”

“Hey, great to meet you, man. Take it easy — *enjoy your time in Talkeetna and have a wonderful journey to Fairbanks.*”

“Thanks so much for the drink — I truly appreciate it.”
“It’s the least I could do. You’ve got a long expedition ahead of you.”
“Welcome, welcome.”

“And we’ve arrived in **Talkeetna**. *I must say, it is considerably colder here compared to Anchorage.* These passengers are stepping off to get some fresh air, while new passengers are boarding and loading their luggage.”

“So do you want me to hold it like this? Is this angle the most important?”

“Yeah, no problem. We can redo it if needed.”

“You have to see our—”

“Thank you so much.”

“No problem at all. We’re filming.”

“All right — jump.”

“Thank you. Do you want to check if it’s okay?”

“Yeah, it’s part of this whole reel we’re making where we jump into and out of the frame.”

“Nice — I like that. Is it good?”

“Yeah, I think so.”

“Perfect — no problem at all.”


“Where are you guys from?”

“Pennsylvania.”

“Nice. I’m from the UK.”

“Oh, awesome. First time in Alaska?”

“Same here.”

“Would you be able to take a picture for us?”

“Of course — no problem at all.”

“You want one as well?”

“No, honestly, it’s fine. But make sure we get *‘Alaska’* in the background.”

“There you go — no problem.”

“So are you on a solo trip?”

“Yeah — I always travel alone. Just exploring Alaska and seeing what unfolds.”

“That’s incredible. Have a fantastic time.”

“Thank you so much — you too.”

“Are you travelling all the way to Fairbanks?”

“Yeah.”

“Us too. We’re heading to the **Borealis Space Camp**.”

“Oh wow — I didn’t even know that existed.”

“Yeah, it’s just outside Fairbanks. We’re staying in these fabricated **igloos** with **glass ceilings** for **Aurora viewing**.”

“That sounds incredible.”

“How long are you in Alaska?”

“We arrived Thursday, and we leave the base camp next Thursday.”

“That will be extraordinary.”

“There’s absolutely nothing here — just one small cabin in the back and that’s about it. I’ll probably need to jump back on the train any second. *Definitely should’ve brought a coat.* Right — back to the warmth.”

“Walking toward the rear of the train now, because the **flag-stop passengers** — those living deep in the wilderness who signal the train to stop — usually wait back here. Just checking whether anyone needs to get off.”

“Do you live in Alaska?”

“Oh yeah — my whole life. I’m getting off here too.”

“Really? So you’re doing the flag-stop as well?”

“Yeah, I’m flag-stopping right now.”

“No way. Where do you live?”

“I grew up out here as a kid.”

“Completely in the wilderness?”

“In the ’60s, yes. There wasn’t even a highway.”

“So when you needed the train, you literally waved it down?”

“Exactly. You’d stand by the tracks and flag it, but back then it was less reliable — you could be standing out there **three or four hours in winter** waiting for it.”

“It would take you all the way to Anchorage, where my grandfather lived. He was our **support system**.”

“So how long would you stay in the wilderness?”

“Months.”

“Really? Did you hunt out here?”

“My dad did — he hunted, trapped, sold furs. Things have changed now, though.”

“So did you work in Anchorage?”

“I’m retired now, but I worked in both Anchorage and Fairbanks.”

“What’s it like living in Alaska?”

“I’ve been here 62 years. It’s been extraordinary. I’ve seen temperatures hit **70 below**, and that’s without windchill.”

“Seventy below? Wow.”

“Any close encounters with wildlife?”

“Oh, certainly — with **grizzly bears**, mostly. They’re everywhere.”

“Where are you from?”

“The UK — from Wales.”

“Oh, Wales! Nice. First time in Alaska?”

“Yeah — my first time.”

“Good job. Welcome.”

“We’ve been tracing our roots, and we still can’t determine whether they’re from Wales or Holland — one of the two.”

“No way — Alaskan roots tracing back to Wales?”

“Yeah — back to the 1700s.”

“So when you get off at a flag-stop, how far is your cabin?”

“When I get off, I walk **six-tenths of a mile** to my cabin. Then I take my **side-by-side** to collect my gear.”

“So you have a truck or an ATV?”

“An ATV — like a quad, but with a utility bed.”

“When I get off, four minutes later I’ll see my cabin across the pond.”

“How big is your cabin?”

“About **1,100 square feet**.”

“That’s pretty big for the middle of nowhere.”

“No road access, but I’ve been building it for **30 years**.”

“You’ve been building it for 30 years? And you did it all yourself?”

“Pretty much. Some supplies come on the train, others I haul by **snow machine** or **snowmobile**.”

“Wow. I don’t think I’d survive out here, to be honest.”

“So how long are you staying before catching the train back?”

“This time I’m returning tomorrow. Next time, probably a week.”

“So you bring food with you, I’m guessing?”
