## 12 Hours On Luxury Alaska Train - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izdZOJv6No8)


**“And these are predominantly local residents who frequently utilise the flag-stop service. So when you drop them off, can they request the train to halt at any designated point?”**
“Yes, they usually provide a **mile-post indicator**, something like **Mile 269.2**, and we disembark them precisely at that coordinate.”

“This is **Tanya**. We manage all the **baggage operations** back here because by the time the train decelerates, passengers naturally congregate in this section. Another *distinctive feature* of the **flag-stop system** is that we even allow their **dogs** on board.”

“So, you must have an entire group of dogs back here?”

“Absolutely. That's why the rear compartment is labelled **‘Flag-Stop Only.’**”

“Does this carriage ever get exceptionally crowded?”

“It can—sometimes it’s **standing-room-only**, and everyone seems to know each other, so it almost turns into a *spontaneous familial reunion*. It’s quintessentially **Alaskan**.”

“Are you originally from Alaska?”

“Born and raised.”

“In Anchorage?”

“Yes, and now I live in **Eagle River**, just outside Anchorage.”

“Wow, that’s remarkable. It’s my first time in Alaska and the landscape looks absolutely **awe-inspiring**. And people here are incredibly **affable**. It’s genuinely wonderful to meet you.”

“You too. I’ll be around—I need to repair a door.”

“No worries. Good luck!”

“Let’s see what this train has to offer because I’m absolutely starving. This is the last carriage—**Car C**—where I’m seated. The entire car consists of **standard reclining seats**, and each seat costs **$259**. *Honestly, for a 12-hour journey with panoramic views of this magnitude, it’s extraordinarily inexpensive.* You’d pay more for a one-hour train ride in the UK.”

“I think this whole train is composed exclusively of seats since there are no **private cabins**. When you walk between the carriages, you immediately feel how cold it is. Thankfully, these compartments are **thermally insulated and heated**. Look at Alaska—this place is unequivocally **magnificent**.”

“Let’s step into this next cabin. Ready to see what the **restrooms** look like? Not bad at all — sink, toilet — and impeccably clean. And it’s probably the best-smelling train restroom I’ve ever encountered.”

“It says ‘bacon.’”

“Ah, maybe try pushing it.”

“I did—oh, there we go. Didn’t push hard enough.”

“No problem.”

“This carriage is identical — all seats, and incredibly quiet. How are you?”

“Good, how are you?”

“Is this your first time on the Alaskan Railroad?”

“Yeah, first time in Alaska too.”

“Where are you from?”

“Kansas City.”

“Nice — I’m from the UK.”

“What brings you to Alaska?”

“My girlfriend and I wanted a tranquil getaway.”

“Same here — I’ve always wanted to explore Alaska, so I’m finally ticking it off the list.”

“That’s fantastic. It was great meeting you.”

“You too. Have a brilliant trip.”

“As soon as these trees move out of the way, you’ll see something extraordinary — **Denali, Mount Hunter, and Mount Foraker**. They’re colossal.”

“So you can see Denali from here?”

“You can see Denali from nearly everywhere in Alaska — Anchorage, Fairbanks — it dominates the skyline. *It’s called the **Great One** for a reason.* This is one of the best ways to experience the **core expanse** of Alaska.”

“What kind of wildlife do you usually encounter?”

“Moose, bears, caribou, foxes, lynx, wolves — the entire **Arctic fauna**. They generally keep their distance because trains are dangerous, but if we’re quick, we often spot them.”

“How many more carriages do I have to go through?”

“You’ve got the **bistro car** for grab-and-go items, then the **café car**, and that’s the end.”

“Perfect. I’ll check it out.”

“All these carriages are identical — no **first-class** or **business-class segmentation**. Just uniform seating.”

“This next one appears to be the **food car**. Let’s see — infused water, salads, sandwiches, yogurts, Alaskan popcorn, crisps. Butter popcorn, cheddar popcorn.”

“Are you grabbing some popcorn?”

“No, trying to be healthy.”

“Oh my god — KitKats.”

“This place is extraordinary. You can literally spot **moose** running in the distance. It’s breathtaking.”

“Hey, how’s it going? Could I get an **English breakfast tea**, please?”

“Would you like milk?”

“Yes, please. Thank you.”

“Busy day?”

“It is indeed. Where are you from?”

“Europe.”

“Beautiful. I haven’t been yet, but I must go.”

“You absolutely should.”

“What brings you from Montenegro to Alaska?”

“My internship.”

“How are you finding it?”

“Quite enjoyable — it’s an intriguing place.”

“It truly is — and stunning.”

“So, which one is better — Alaska or Montenegro?”

“Oh, Alaska is exceptional.”

“Thank you. That’ll be **$2.50**.”

“Thanks so much.”

“You’re welcome.”

**My first time in Alaska — unforgettable.”**
