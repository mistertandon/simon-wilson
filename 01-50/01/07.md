**“The chicken sandwich? Are you planning to have dinner as well?”**
“Yeah, I’ll do dinner.”
“I’d recommend saving the **pot roast** or the **penne entrée** for dinner. But for lunch, that **chicken melt** is excellent.”
“How spicy is the chicken melt?”
“It’s moderately spicy. You can remove the **jalapeños** if you prefer.”
“Amazing. Can I order with you, or do I order elsewhere?”
“Your server will take your order at the table.”

“Perfect. *Thank you so much for your assistance.*”
“Of course — thank you.”

“Hey, how’s it going?”
“Good — no problem at all. Could I get the **chicken sandwich**, please? And a **Sprite**, if that’s okay.”
“Sprite — perfect. Would you like **Swiss** or **cheddar** cheese on the sandwich?”
“Swiss, please.”
“It comes with **potato chips**.”
“Perfect — thank you. Appreciate it.”
“Any condiments? Ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard?”
“Ketchup, please.”
“Ketchup — got it.”

“Look at this — **chicken**, **bacon**, **Swiss cheese**, lettuce, crisps, and a bottle of ketchup.”
*I must say, I genuinely admire this train experience.*
“Right, let’s give this a try.”

“Oh wow — that is exceptional. This is unbelievably good.”
“I chose the chicken.”
“Good recommendation.”
“Glad you like it.”
“How good is that?”
“Yeah, it’s delicious. I could easily eat another one.”
“I’d recommend the **bolognese** or the **dinner entrée**.”
“Bolognese for dinner — perfect.”

“I had no idea a chicken burger could taste this good.”
“Well, that’s a stellar review.”
“Oh, **10 out of 10**. Chicken burger — **$18**. Sprite — **$3.50**. Absolute bargain.”

“We need to find out who made this chicken burger. Who’s responsible for these?”
“These two gentlemen right here.”
“That chicken burger was phenomenal — a solid 10 out of 10.”
“Glad you enjoyed it.”
“How are you, man — all good?”
“All good.”

“Looks like we’re pulling into another station. I’m going to jump off and take a look.”
“How long do we have here?”
“About 10–15 minutes. It’s not an exact amount, so stay close by.”
“Got it — I won’t go far.”

*You can feel the temperature plummeting — and this is still considered warm by Alaskan standards.*

“Watch your step — it’s icy.”
*It’s getting progressively colder as this journey continues.*
“That’s the entire train behind me. Let’s take a look around.”

“Apparently the whole area is boarded up and only open in summer. Everything is completely locked — like a **ghost town**.”

“From what I can tell, Alaska becomes extremely busy in summer due to tourism. I always manage to visit back to front.”
“This is the **visitor centre** — all the informational boards with Alaskan history.”

“There’s absolutely nobody here. Are these restrooms open?”
“No — closed.”

“This is the main depot — **Denali Park Depot**. There’s snow everywhere, and everything is fully secured for winter.”
“These are the notice boards — ‘**Summer 25**’. That’s it. The entire place sealed.”

“Oh, it’s cold. And it’s only going to get colder as we head farther north. We still have several hours to go.”

“At least I made it back before the train departed.”
“I’m getting back on — I need a hot brew. *That was absolutely Baltic.* Too cold.”

---

“We’ve just left **Denali**, heading to Fairbanks — and as you can see, we’ve hit a **snowstorm**.
*It will be brutally freezing in Fairbanks.*”

“We’ve been on this train for nine hours — three more to go. To be fair, it’s gone quickly.
*From all the trains I’ve taken, this one offers the most extraordinary scenery.*
I’m trying to think of any that rival it — none come close.”

“This journey has been phenomenal. Definitely **$259 well spent**.”

“The lady just announced dinner is ready — free for all.”
“You’re not joining for dinner?”
“No, I’m good.”
“You’re skipping another chicken sandwich?”
“I might need to sneak out for one.”

“Is it just me, or is this carriage significantly warmer?”
“No — it is. We sat in the coldest carriage earlier.”
“Everyone is wearing coats — and I still don’t have one.”

“Hey, how’s it going?”
“Another chicken burger.”
“There you go.”
“Who’s winning the cards?”
“Not sure yet — I’ll check the champion on my way back.”

“I have one more table available — if people don’t mind sharing, I can seat more of you.”
“I don’t mind — is that okay with everyone?”
“Perfect. After you.”
“After you. Thank you.”

“How’s it going — all good?”
“How was dinner?”
“Delicious.”
“Good — you’ve all been *eating your way through the entire train*.”
