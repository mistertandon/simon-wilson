## 12 Hours On Luxury Alaska Train - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izdZOJv6No8)


*Morning, and welcome to **Anchorage, Alaska**. It is exactly **7:00 a.m.**, and the temperature is **freezing**. I genuinely have **no idea** where I am heading, and I do not even have a **coat**, but my sole intention today is to travel from **Anchorage** to **Fairbanks**—provided I successfully reach the **train station**. This is my **first visit** to Alaska and, naturally, my first experience on an **Alaska Railroad train**.*

The ticket cost me **$259**, which is **not particularly economical** for a **12-hour rail journey**, and I am still unsure whether I booked a **cabin** or merely a **standard seat**. We shall discover shortly. *My goodness, it is astonishingly cold.*

Right, here we go. For once, I am actually **on time**. There is a train right behind me.

If you look over here, you might see the sign displaying **“Alaska Railroad”** at the top of the station building. Let us see what we are dealing with. There are **quite a few passengers** present this morning. Please tell me this is not the **queue**.

“Is this line for tickets or boarding?”

“For the ticket.”

“Perfect, thank you.”

This is a **surprisingly long queue**.

A considerable number of passengers seem to be taking this train today.

“Good morning, how are you?”

“May I see your **ID**, please?”

“Thank you. It’s a busy morning.”

A man approaches me.

“I’ve seen your vlog videos.”

“No way—small world. What’s your name?”

“Tyrone.”

“Nice to meet you, Tyrone. I’m Simon. Sorry—this is my first time in Alaska.”
“We hope you enjoy it. You’ll be in **Car C**, **Row 12**, **Seat A**. Just wait near the rear access point.”

“Perfect. Thank you so much for your help.”

So far, so good. I have the ticket. It looks **elegant**, branded with **‘Alaska Railroad – Your Ticket to the Alaska Adventure.’**
Seat **12A**, Car **C**, and the route from **Anchorage to Fairbanks** is clearly printed.

There is a public announcement—we might be ready to board. It is unbelievably cold. This is the train: the **locomotive** is down there, and this larger section is presumably the **dining car**. There are several carriages, though the overall **rolling stock** seems smaller than expected given the crowd.

“That’s Car A. Which one am I again? Car C.”

A lady nearby asks, “Would you like me to take a picture of both of you?”

“Yes, please. Thank you so much. Let me include the Alaska sign in the background.”

“There you go. Safe journey!”

Another person exclaims, “I saw you on TikTok!”

“Really? Small world. I like your jumper—I need an Alaska jumper myself.”

“What’s your name?”

“Sean. I’m from **Taiwan**, from **Taipei**.”

“Beautiful. I hope to visit Taipei someday.”

“It’s my first time in Alaska.”

“How do you like it?”

“Very cold. At least you have a coat.”

“You’re travelling alone?”

“No, with a group of ten friends. We’re here for an **internship program**.”

“Oh lovely. Are you based in Alaska?”

“No, in **Boston**.”

“You’re here to explore Alaska?”

“Yes, mainly to see the **Northern Lights**.”

“Have you seen them yet?”

“Not yet. Hopefully in Fairbanks.”

A staff member greets me:
“Good morning. Head up the stairs, then turn left. Seat numbers are located beneath the window. Watch your step and use the handrails.”

“Fantastic—lovely energy this early.”

“The sunshine will rise shortly. It’s going to be beautiful.”

I locate **12A** and settle in.

A ride guide is available.

“It’s a **mile-post guide**—it explains what you’re passing, even if the landscape appears empty. Some areas are **military zones**.”

“It’s $5, cash only.”

“No problem, let me check.”

“Where are you visiting from?”

“Manchester in the UK.”

“Welcome to the US!”

Another passenger greets me.

“I’m originally from here, but now live in **North Dakota**.”

“Why did you move?”

“Work.”

“My name is Aaron.”

“Nice to meet you, Aaron. How does North Dakota compare to Alaska?”
“Well, Alaska is certainly more scenic. I’m originally from Anchorage.”
