## 12 Hours On Luxury Alaska Train - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izdZOJv6No8)

**“Yeah, I didn’t bring supplies this trip because I already have some at the cabin, and I’m only staying overnight. I’m travelling light — I actually brought **Starlink** with me.”**
“Oh, you’ve got **Starlink** in the cabin?”
“I have it right here with me.”
“No way — so you’re setting it up today?”
“Yeah, I want to make sure it works.”
“Do you have **solar panels**?”
“No, but my brother does. I just use a **generator**.”

“So when’s your stop? How long until you get off?”
“Ten to fifteen minutes, probably.”
“Ah, not long then. What was your name again?”
“Jamie.”
“Jamie — I’m Simon.”
“Jameson, actually.”
“Really? Jameson — nice.”

“How do you find it — living out in a remote **wilderness cabin**?”
“It’s incredibly peaceful. I sleep better out there than anywhere else.”
“I can imagine. The nights must be pitch-black — no ambient light at all.”
“Oh, yeah. Absolutely no **light pollution**. *You see the stars and the **Aurora Borealis** with perfect clarity.* It’s tranquil — just you, the silence, and the wildlife.”

“So what’s the next stop — was it **Shannon**, you said?”
“Yeah, we’re stopping briefly to pick her up.”
“And she’s been living out here for fifty years?”
“Yep — she lives entirely off-grid. She’s got **solar and wind power**, but I’ve got the better view.”

*The conductor behind me is making an announcement about a woman named **Shannon**, who has lived completely in the Alaskan wilderness for fifty years. The train is literally about to stop in the middle of nowhere so she can hop on.*

“You looking forward to getting back to your cabin?”
“Oh, absolutely.”
“Would you prefer living at the cabin or in Anchorage?”
“Oh, the cabin. Especially now that I’m retired.”

“What’s the longest you’ve stayed out there — not counting when you lived there permanently?”
“Three weeks.”
“And when you lived there permanently, you were out there full-time?”
“Yep.”

“All right — she’s boarding now. Give her a moment.”

“This is Shannon.”
“Hi, how are you? You good?”
“Good — good to see you.”
“I’ve got your spot right here, honey.”
“Oh, thank you.”
“She’s beautiful — you should sell your crafts on the train.”
“I know — mine would be a bit different though. Most of mine are drinking stories.”

“When you lived here permanently, how did you get **food and supplies**?”
“You relied entirely on the **railroad**. It was the lifeline — a revenue source for them and a survival mechanism for us. Everyone needed goods delivered.”

*Shannon — the woman who has lived in the wilderness for fifty years — is now greeting passengers and selling her handmade items.*

“This is a **flag-stop** — you can see the tree bent over with the flag attached. And that quad bike over there — I’m guessing her husband uses it to collect their Amazon parcels.”

“Lovely to meet you.”
“You too.”

Shannon and her dog are stepping off the train now. *It’s astonishing — imagine living in a place this isolated.*

“You’ve got the **Starlink kit** in your bag?”
“Yeah, it’s in the luggage car.”
“I bet you’re excited. Do you have a TV in the cabin?”
“Oh yeah — and I’ve got **600 DVDs**.”
“Really?”
“But now I can finally get **Netflix**.”
“You’re all set then.”
“I think I need to build a cabin next door.”

“Gloves and coat on — ready for winter.”
“All right, man — Jamie, it’s been a pleasure. Stay in touch.”
“We will, for sure. Take care.”

*This is genuinely the most **bizarre yet fascinating train system** I’ve ever experienced — passengers literally jumping off into the wilderness whenever they want, living entirely off-grid.*

“I’m heading to the back of the train — is this where you unload your luggage?”
“Yeah.”
“Need a hand, Jamie?”
“I just push it over to David.”
“No problem.”

“Daniel — this is easy.”
“Really?”
“Yeah — this is nothing.”

“Perfect — got it.”
“There you go — thanks, guys.”
“See you tomorrow.”
“All right, Jamie — have a good one.”
“See you later, man. All the best.”

“Where’s your cabin from here?”
“Once we round the corner, you’ll see it — right in the middle.”
“And later we’ll see **Denali** too.”
“No way — that’s incredible.”

“Have a good one, Jamie. Enjoy Netflix tonight.”

---

*I still can’t believe how people simply flag the train down and live in absolute isolation. Tomorrow, on our southbound journey, they’ll all be out there waving us down again. It’s surreal.*

Jamie has already jumped off — heading straight out into the wilderness to set up his **Starlink** so he can stream Netflix. *Part of me wishes I were going with him.*

“Right — I’m finally going to check out this **dining car**. I haven’t eaten all day.”

“Thanks — looking forward to getting some food.”
“I’ll take you to a table.”
“Thank you so much.”
“You made it.”
“I made it — finally.”
“All right — we’ve got one more to seat.”
“Hey, how’s it going, man?”
“All good.”
“Great — thank you so much.”
“You’re welcome. The server will be right with you.”

“This is the menu?”
“That’s the **beverage menu**.”
“Oh, perfect. Any recommendations?”
“I’m particularly fond of the **chicken sandwich** — purely personal preference.”
