## 12 Hours On Luxury Alaska Train - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izdZOJv6No8)

**“How are you liking it so far?”**
“Yeah, it’s astounding. *Some of these panoramic views from the train are genuinely **breathtaking**, aren’t they?* How many times have you travelled on this route?”

“A multitude. I completed the entire **summer operational season**, and this is my first winter working aboard the train.”

“Which season is superior — winter or summer?”

“Definitely summer.”

“Thank you so much. Lovely meeting you.”

“You too.”

“Down here you’ve got tables where you can **consume meals** while admiring the **Alaskan landscape** through the windows. But what is located up here? I don’t think I’ve ever seen a **balcony-style observation deck** on a train before. How extraordinary is this? You’ve got the dining tables below, viewing windows all around, and additional seats with an elevated vantage point.”

*“I must say, I am profoundly impressed by this train, and everyone has been remarkably **affable**.”*

“I’m assuming the **Dome Car** is the next carriage. How many more cars are there in that direction?”

“There’s only one more car beyond this point, but you’re not permitted to go further.”

“Ah, understood. I’ll take a quick look. Thank you.”

“Well, I’m originally from Wales, but I currently live in Manchester in the UK.”

“No way—really? I recognise a subtle **Manchester intonation** in your accent.”

“Do you think so? I hope not, but perhaps it’s inevitable.”

“I’m sorry—it’s faint, but noticeable. I have friends from Leeds.”

“Ah yes, not far at all.”

“And Bradford.”

“No way!”

“I visited in February and stayed for seven weeks, though I lived in Argent. It was absolutely delightful.”

“So where are you originally from?”

“I was born in Ohio, but I live in Texas now.”

“What brings you to Alaska?”

“I wanted to see the **Aurora Borealis** and experience this train journey.”

“So far, so good?”

“It’s phenomenal.”

“It is, isn’t it? Are you both from Texas?”

“No, I grew up in Illinois, just south of Chicago. I’ve lived in Texas for 35 years.”

“Wow. Which part of Texas?”

“We live in a small town.”

“So how long are you staying in Alaska?”

“We’re here for about a week. We’ll spend a couple of nights in an **igloo lodge**, visit the **Chena Hot Springs**, and explore the region. There’s so much to do here — countless destinations.”

“And the contrast between seasons must be immense.”

“Absolutely. Most people recommend summer because everything is so **vibrant and picturesque**.”

“When I came five years ago, they told me, *‘You must return in summer — it’s indescribably beautiful.’*”

“Are you travelling alone?”

“Yes, I travel everywhere solo.”

“I also travel alone frequently. How liberating is it?”

“I adore it. But she’s retired now, so I’m going to start taking her with me.”

“That’s great — at least you have companionship when you want it.”

“My husband is disabled and refuses to leave the house. So I simply say, ‘Your loss — see you later.’”

“So lovely to meet you. What was your name?”

“Deanna.”

“Deanna — I’m Simon. Nice to meet you.”

“Simon. And I’m Jackie.”

“Jackie — easy to remember.”

“So do you travel light too — backpack and small luggage?”

“Just a backpack. I never carry a suitcase.”

“I wish I could do that.”

“Well, the downside is… I didn’t bring a coat. Not ideal in Alaska.”

“You don’t have a coat?”

“Nope.”

“You need to buy yourself one.”

“I know — I think in Fairbanks it will be **sub-zero**, around -20°C.”

“You’re going to freeze.”

“I’ll learn the hard way.”

“Look through those trees — a moose!”

“There — a moose! Incredible. And look at Denali National Park in the distance — see the peaks?”

“Beautiful. Lovely meeting you — enjoy your trip.”

“An announcement just came through that the train is stopping, so I’m stepping off to explore. What’s this stop called?”
“**Talkeetna**.”

“Is it a big place or a small town?”

“A tiny town — about 100 people. Maybe 200 during peak season.”

“There are many little **tourist-oriented shops** here, though some are closed for winter. Most Alaskan towns **boom during summer tourism** and then become quiet in winter.”

“I have two ticketed passengers to board, but I also see several **flag-stop travellers**.”

“All right, watch your step. Let me get the stairs — I’ll be right back.”
